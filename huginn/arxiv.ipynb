      "This paper presents a high-performance consensus protocol, Nezha, which canbe deployed by cloud tenants without any support from their cloud provider.Nezha bridges the gap between protocols such as Multi-Paxos and Raft, which canbe readily deployed and protocols such as NOPaxos and Speculative Paxos, thatprovide better performance, but require access to technologies such asprogrammable switches and in-network prioritization, which cloud tenants do nothave. Nezha uses a new multicast primitive called deadline-ordered multicast(DOM). DOM uses high-accuracy software clock synchronization to synchronizesender and receiver clocks.

In throughput, Nezha outperforms all baselines by amedian of 5.4x (range: 1.9-20.9x). In latency, Nezha outperforms five baselinesby a median of 2.3x (range: 1.3-4.0x), with one exception: it sacrifices 33%latency compared with our optimized NOPaxos in one test.

Below are some related concepts and background information:\\n\\n1. Consensus: In distributed computing, consensus refers to the process of agreeing on a certain value or decision among a group of distributed nodes. Consensus protocols are used to ensure that all nodes in the system reach agreement on the same value, even in the presence of failures or network partitions.\\n\\n2. Multi-Paxos: Multi-Paxos is a well-known consensus protocol that is widely used in distributed systems. It involves a leader election mechanism and a two-phase commit algorithm to ensure agreement among nodes.\\n\\n3. Raft: Raft is another consensus protocol that is similar to Multi-Paxos but aims to be more understandable and easier to implement. It uses a leader election mechanism and a replicated state machine to ensure agreement among nodes.\\n\\n4. NOPaxos and Speculative Paxos: These are two consensus protocols that can provide better performance than Multi-Paxos and Raft, but require access to advanced technologies such as programmable switches and in-network prioritization.\\n\\n5. Deadline-ordered multicast (DOM): DOM is a new multicast primitive introduced in the Nezha protocol, which uses high-accuracy software clock synchronization to synchronize sender and receiver clocks. It allows senders to tag messages with deadlines in synchronized time, and receivers to process messages in deadline order.\\n\\n6. Cloud computing: Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, applications, and other resources. Cloud tenants are users who rent or purchase these services from cloud providers.\\n\\nOverall, the Nezha protocol aims to bridge the gap between easily deployable consensus protocols and high-performance but advanced consensus protocols, making it easier for cloud tenants to achieve high-performance consensus without the need for advanced technologies.\", \"link\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03285\"}\n"
