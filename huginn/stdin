Nezha uses a new multicast primitive called deadline-ordered multicast\\n(DOM). DOM uses high-accuracy software clock synchronization to synchronize\\nsender and receiver clocks. Senders tag messages with deadlines in synchronized\\ntime; receivers process messages in deadline order, on or after their deadline.\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;We compare Nezha with Multi-Paxos, Fast Paxos, Raft, a NOPaxos version we\\noptimized for the cloud, and 2 recent protocols, Domino and TOQ-EPaxos, that\\nuse synchronized clocks. In throughput, Nezha outperforms all baselines by a\\nmedian of 5.4x (range: 1.9-20.9x). In latency, Nezha outperforms five baselines\\nby a median of 2.3x (range: 1.3-4.0x), with one exception: it sacrifices 33%\\nlatency compared with our optimized NOPaxos in one test. We also prototype two\\napplications, a key-value store and a fair-access stock exchange, on top of\\nNezha to show that Nezha only modestly reduces their performance relative to an\\nunreplicated system.
